# Index-of-Last-Character

**write a program to reverse the digits of a given two-digit number.**

Input: Python

Output: 5

Explanation:

Let's break down the solution for the coding question 'Reverse the Digits' into simple steps.

Step 1: Get the input
First, we need to get the input from the user, which is a word. Here, input() is a function that allows the user to enter a word, and word is a variable that stores the entered word.

Step 2:Find the length of the wordNext, we need to find out how many letters are in the word. We can do this using the len() function.
len() is a function that gives us the number of characters in a string. Here, word_length is a variable that will store the length of the word.

Step 3: Calculate the Index of the Last Character
Now that we have the length of the word, we need to calculate the index of the last character. In Python, the index starts at 0, so we can find the index of the last character by subtracting 1 from the length of the word.

Step 4: Print the Index
Finally, we'll print the index of the last character on the screen using the print() function.
The print() function displays the value of the last_index variable, which is the index of the last character of the word.

Follow the above steps to print the index of the last character
